        <p> Chess is one of my other hobbies. I am a captain of my school's chess club and chess team, and I play chess regularily on <a href="https://lichess.org" target =_blank"> Lichess</a>, with the username BeagleBone. </p>
        <p> Here are some of my favorite games that I've played! </p>

        <h2>BeagleBone vs Peter-Bon22 (1-0) </h2>
        
        <p> This game was not played very well from my end, but ir stood out to me because of how much of a positional game it was. The pawns were locked for a large portion of the game, and after a back and forth middlegame, I managed to push my pawn to promote. This happened through a passed pawn after a trade of queens.
